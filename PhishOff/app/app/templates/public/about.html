          <h2>Why Phishing?</h2>
          <p class="aboutinfo2">Phishing is a profound problem that is often overlooked due to people being unaware of the consequences and not being aware of computer security. Phishing is the easiest attack to create and execute so criminals are everywhere, being aware of the methods that are used to carry out these attacks is essential.
            If you are victim of a Social engineering attack like Phishing it can be devestating due to the attackers usually striving for financial gain. Most attackers, if not all are ruthless due to it being an anonymous attack that can be incredibly difficult to trace.
